# Test Driving Files

This Folder contains the driving files for the AMR

### Discliamer
When I wrote most of these files, only God and I knew how it works. Now only God knows!

### Usage
Anyways, the only running code is the Running_lidoutputstate.py file, the rest only God knows what it is and what it does, it was suppose to do similar thing which is running the code forward and stop / slowdown based on the lidaroutputstate, but it doesn't works.
